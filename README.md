# Productivity Bundle Task Manager

A full-stack productivity web application that seamlessly integrates a Task Manager, Notes & Journaling, and a Pomodoro Timer‚Äîdesigned to help users stay organized, focused, and motivated. Built using Node.js, Express, MongoDB, and vanilla JavaScript, the app delivers a minimalist yet responsive user experience with practical features and clean UI enhancements.

This is part of an evolving Productivity Bundle specifically tailored for students. I plan to continuously expand it with tools and enhancements to support effective study habits and time management.
